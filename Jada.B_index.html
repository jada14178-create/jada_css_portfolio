    <h1>A little about me </h1>
    <p>College has become a place for me to grow as a young lady... to find myself as a new designer amd harold my entrance into adulthood.

As a Communication Design major, I enjoy exploring the creative side of visual storytelling while also learning practical skills that will help me in my future career.

Although I consider myself more of a designer at heart, I have entry-level experience with coding. which I find to be both challenging and rewarding as it opens new doors for blending design with technology.
